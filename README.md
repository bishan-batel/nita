## How to Build & Run

### Installing Godot
<b><a href="https://godotengine.org/download">Download Here</a></b> 
Make sure to download the "Godot Mono x64" (or x32) version

After downloading, you need to unzip the contents of the .zip file into a 
secure directory and you need to make sure you keep where you store this file
consistent. I recommend in your home folder (filepath: `/home/your_username/`)
<br>

Make sure to put both the 'GodotSharp' folder and the 'Godot_v3.3.3-stable_mono_x11_64' file into a folder
named 'godot' (my example, inside `/home/your_username/godot/`)

After, rename the executable to just 'godot'

### Build & Run Script
To get the build and run script either download 'build_and_run.sh' from the repo above

After you get your run .sh file, run it with the terminal to launch the project.
<br>It should open the godot window with it saying "building solutions...", 
<br>After it is finished with build solutions (and/or reimporting assets), click the play button in the top right corner of the screen to run the project (5 icons to the left from 'Build').
